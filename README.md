# Real time chat app - SignalR

This is a simple real-time chat app developed to practice some knowledge about websockets and ASP.NET Core. Although this project was focused on the backend, I used Next.Js with TailwindCss for the frontend.

The frontend and backend can comunicate with each other using the SignalR library.

## Running the application

After cloning the repo, you may run `npm i` inside the `./client` folder. After that, you can run `npm run dev` to start the frontend.

To start the backend app, you may run `dotnet run` on the root folder.

Now it's time to have fun!
